Known Issues

Reinforcements will be given move orders on spawn, however if the obj changes while they are en-route, they will not get that change and instead make their way to the older obj, which could waste time
Instead, we need a way to redirect RF if the obj changes

---

Blufor can take a point - however before the 1/2/3/point opfor RF move in, there could be a stalemate where opfor dug-in defenders remain hidden - this breaks the flow
There is an Insurance Move for 1/2/3/Point opfor, there should be something similar for Blufor at this earlier stage

---

There is no direction over the flow of patrol points, and posentially these could drift quite far away fom peraBase.
Granted, this takes a while, but if this was to be on all the time, perhaps some automated transport would be needed?

---
